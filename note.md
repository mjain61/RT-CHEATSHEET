This cheatsheet is still in progress<br>
soon i'll be updating it with linux privilege escalation (like getting privileges with kubernetes, binaries, suid, docker, 0days etc) and other methodologies for windows priv esc as well as more ways to attack AD using 0days and other misconfigurations<br>
that is the advanced methods of performing red teaming activity(authenticated and unauthenticated)<br>
main reference from: https://www.ired.team/<br>
<B>NOTE: this cheatsheet doesn't include the av evasion techniques or edr bypasses</b><br>
i'll be adding that soon
